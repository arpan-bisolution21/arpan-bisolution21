## 🚀 Executive Positioning  

Business Intelligence Data Analyst focused on transforming operational and transactional data into structured, KPI-driven decision intelligence.

Specialized in performance analysis, variance diagnostics, and executive dashboard engineering using Power BI and SQL-based data modeling.

I operate with a disciplined analytical framework designed to convert raw datasets into measurable business value.

## 🧩 Strategic Differentiation  

What sets me apart:

- KPI-first analytical mindset (metrics before visuals)  
- Structured statistical reasoning before interpretation  
- Executive-ready dashboard architecture  
- Precision in data validation and preprocessing  
- AI-augmented insight synthesis using LLMs (GPT)  

I do not just build reports — I build decision systems.
